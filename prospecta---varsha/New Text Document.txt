
Theoretical Challenge-----

1.  How will you tackle the challenge above?

First I will take help from error while writting programme.
Codes should be neat and clean because if i get any error it is easy it find out.
Also while writting codes keep focusing  on the syntaxes it will give errors if it is not proper.
While witiing formulaes it ensures that it should be proper otherwise it should not give correct answer.
After completing i will check on online tool csvLint.

2.Types of common error are as follows:

1. File size : 

One of the most common CSV import errors is that the file is simply too large. 
That can be caused by too many fields or records in the file, too many columns, or too many rows. 
The import error can be caused by limits set by the program using the file or the amount of 
available memory on the system.

2. Matching:

Another key import error that pops up when uploading a CSV file is related to matching. 
This could be columns that don’t match expected field names caused by different values 
than expected, field names not on the first line, or simply the complete absence of column names.

3. Translation:

A data translation error could occur if the encoding is incorrect or unexpected. 
Another cause could be the presence of non-standard characters that aren’t usable.

4. Values:

Issues with data values can be a significant cause of CSV importing errors. 
These include unexpected data length – either too long or too short. 
It could also mean unacceptable characters such as text in a numbers-only 
column or numbers in a boolean

5. Missing data

Missing data is one of the most common errors for CSV imports. 
Examples include incomplete data that can be fixed by a user such as 
invoices that have month and day, but no year information.

6. Non-digestible formats:

Non-digestible formats include simple format mismatches that need format normalizations 
such as phone numbers or social security numbers which are numbers only without symbols. 
Complex format mismatches would need format normalization AND data normalization such as 
when the date format is different than expected, inconsistent, or includes text rather 
than being normalized.
